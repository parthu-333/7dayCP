# 🧭 Day 4: Prefix Sum

## 📅 Reminder  
> 🚨 **AtCoder Contest today at 5:30 PM** — Don't miss it! Try to apply prefix sum knowledge if any relevant problems come up.

---

## 📖 Definition
**Prefix Sum** is an array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of elements from index `0` to `i` in the original array.  
It is a powerful technique to answer range queries in constant time after linear-time precomputation.

---

## 🚀 Why Use Prefix Sum?
- Speeds up repeated range sum calculations  
- Useful in subarray problems, matrix queries, and advanced optimizations  
- Reduces time complexity from O(n) per query to O(1)
